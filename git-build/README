                      =============================
                      README File for Likewise Open
                      =============================

Likewise Open has several goals:

(a) Simplify the process of joining non-Microsoft hosts to Active Directory
    domains,
(b) Simplify the management of these hosts, and
(c) Provide a rich development platform for writing applications in
    heterogeneous networks.

We hope you find this software useful.

Instructions on building likewise-open
======================================

The likewise-open build uses makekit (http://mkbuild.sourceforge.net)
While the code is portable among a variety of *nix based platforms
(Linux, Solaris, AIX, HP-UX, and OS X), this build system is 
primarily intended for Linux & FreeBSD platforms.

The tool chain no longer relies on libtool and autoconf.  We recommend
any recent gcc 4.x release to compile.

Before you begin, please read over this list of prerequisite development
packages (depending on your Linux distro):

  * RedHat/Fedora - gcc, glibc-devel, libuuid-devel, pam-devel, ncurses-devel,
    flex, bison, rpm-build, rpm-devel, openssl-devel, popt-devel, libxml2-devel

    Optional packages: 
       o libglade2-devel - To build domainjoin-gui GTK application
       o libattr-devel   - To enable extended attribute support for the 
                           Likewise CIFS server (experimental)
       o 32bit development tools and libraries for compatibility packages
         when building on x86_64
         - glibc-devel.i686, libuuid-devel.i686, libgcc.i686,
           pam-devel.i686

  * Ubuntu - build-essential, fakeroot, devscripts, debhelper,
    autoconf, automake, libtool, libncurses5-dev, uuid-dev,
    flex, bison, libpam0g-dev, libssl-dev, libxml2-dev, libpopt-dev

    Optional packages: 
       o libglade2-dev - To build domainjoin-gui GTK application
       o libattr1-dev  - To enable extended attribute support for the 
                         Likewise CIFS server (experimental)
       o 32bit development tools and libraries for compatibility packages
         when building on x86_64
         - ia32-libs, libc6-dev-i386, gcc-multilib


The easiest way to begin a build is to run:

  $ mkdir debug && cd debug
  $ ../configure --debug
  $ make -jXX package  ## where XX is 2x CPU cores

This will build the necessary binaries and libraries and package them up into
DEBs or RPMs in the likewise-open/debug/package/ directory.

You may view the complete set of configure options by running

  $ ../configure --help

If you are working directory from the likewise-open git tree, the
"'build/mkdist" script can be used to generate a release tarball file.


Note: When not installing using the local package managers (DEB or RPM),
it is necessary to manually import all the service registry files after
installing the binaries.

  $ sudo bash -c 'for file in /opt/likewise/share/config/*reg; do \
      /opt/likewise/bin/regshell import $file; \
    done'


Likewise Registry Service
=========================

The Likewise Registry Service (lwregd) is the configuration data store
used by all Likewise services.  You can view and modify the registry
settings by running /opt/likewise/bin/regshell as the root user.  For
example:

  $ sudo /opt/likewise/bin/regshell
  > cd hkey_this_machine\\services

  hkey_this_machine\services> dir
  [hkey_this_machine\services]
  [HKEY_THIS_MACHINE\Services\lsass]
  ...

  hkey_this_machine\services> cd lsass

  hkey_this_machine\services\lsass> dir
  Arguments    REG_SZ   "lsassd --syslog"
  Dependencies REG_SZ   "netlogon lwio lwreg rdr"
  Description  REG_SZ    "Likewise Security and Authentication Subsystem"
  Path         REG_SZ    "/opt/likewise/sbin/lsassd"
  Type         REG_DWORD 0x00000001 (1)

  [HKEY_THIS_MACHINE\Services\lsass\Parameters]


Likewise Service Manager
========================

The Likewise Service Manager (lwsmd) provides a service control
architecture for starting and stopping all Likewise daemons and drivers
based on a dependency graph.

The lwsmd daemon itself is managed using the standard SysV init
script:

  $ /etc/init.d/lwsmd start
  * Starting Likewise Service Manager: lwsmd              [ OK ] 

Only the registry service (lwregd) is hard coded to be started
initially.  The user space CLI for managing services is the "lwsm"
utility.

  $ lwsm list
  lwreg       running (standalone: 19415)
  dcerpc      running (standalone: 19453)
  eventlog    stopped
  lsass       running (standalone: 19475)
  lwio        running (standalone: 19438)
  rdr         running (io: 19438)
  srv         running (io: 19438)
  pvfs        running (io: 19438)
  npfs        running (io: 19438)
  netlogon    running (standalone: 19468)
  srvsvc      running (standalone: 19529)

  $ lwsm info lsass
  Service: lsass
  Description: Likewise Security and Authentication Subsystem
  Type: executable
  Autostart: no
  Path: /opt/likewise/sbin/lsassd
  Arguments: 'lsassd' '--syslog'
  Dependencies: netlogon lwio lwreg rdr

  $ lwsm stop lsass
  Stopping service reverse dependency: srvsvc
  Stopping service reverse dependency: srv
  Stopping service: lsass

  $ lwsm start srvsvc
  Starting service dependency: lsass
  Starting service dependency: srv
  Starting service: srvsvc



Likewise-CIFS
=============

We are actively implementing a full SMBv1 and SMBv2 protocol stack in the
Likewise I/O Manager.  Some overview information and details about the
server architecture are available at http://www.likewiseopen.org/.
The server offers support for the following client architectures:

  * WinXP
  * Vista
  * Win2003/2008 (including R2)
  * Windows 7
  * OS 10.5 and later
  * Linux CIFS fs and Gnome Desktop smb:// URL

No support is planned for Windows 9x or OS X releases prior to 10.5

If you are interested in tracking Likewise development or just experimenting
with upcoming release feature, please note that the server drivers
(srv.sys.so, pvfs.sys.so, and npvfs.sys.so) are not loaded by default.
The easier way to start the CIFS server to for force the Likewise
Service Manager (lwsmd) to launch all the dependent services for the
srvsvcd daemon (lwsm start-all srvsvc)/

Finally, the SRV driver exports the /lwcifs directory as the C$ share.
This directory is created for you automatically and cannot currently
be disabled.

This following is a short list of known issues in the Likewise CIFS 
server:

  * No file system integration with byte-range locks or change
    notification (planned)
  * No printing support (future ??)
