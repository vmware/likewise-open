 *     ZCT (Zero Copy Transfer) API
 *
 * @defails
 *
 *     The ZCT (zero copy transfer) API supports an abstraction for
 *     performing I/O to/from file system drivers (FSDs) such that the
 *     FSD can pass internal buffers and/or file descriptors to the caller
 *     for reading/writing directly into the file system buffers/file
 *     descriptors.
