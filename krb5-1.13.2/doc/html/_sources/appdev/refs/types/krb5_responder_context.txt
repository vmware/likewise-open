.. c:type:: krb5_responder_context
..

A container for a set of preauthentication questions and answers.

A responder context is supplied by the krb5 authentication system to a :c:type:`krb5_responder_fn` callback. It contains a list of questions and can receive answers. Questions contained in a responder context can be listed using :c:func:`krb5_responder_list_questions()` , retrieved using :c:func:`krb5_responder_get_challenge()` , or answered using :c:func:`krb5_responder_set_answer()` . The form of a question's challenge and answer depend on the question name.
