# @brief Generate html documentation
# @usage INPUT=input_list
# @option INPUT=input_list a list of files that should be
# processed by <cmd>doxygen</cmd>
# @option HEADERDIRS=dir_list a list of source directories
# relative to the current MakeKitBuild where public header
# files are installed (e.g. by <funcref>mk_headers</funcref>).
# The headers will be added to the input list automatically.
# @option DOXYFILE a Doxygen configuration file to use. If
# not specified, defaults to <lit>Doxyfile</lit>.  The file
# should not specify any options controlling input or output
# files as they will be filled in automatically.
# @option INSTALLDIR=dir where to install the html documentation.
# Defaults to <lit>$MK_HTMLDIR/doxygen</lit>.
#
# Processes the specified input file and headers with doxygen
# and outputs documentation in html format.  You must provide
# a Doxyfile in the current directory (or override the path
# using <lit>DOXYFILE=</lit><param>doxyfile</param>) to control
# any customizable Doxygen settings.
#
# To use this function, you must use <funcref>mk_check_doxygen</funcref>
# in a <lit>configure</lit> section of your project, and it must succeed.
# You can test whether Doxygen was found with <funcref>mk_have_doxygen</funcref>.
# This function will abort if Doxygen is unavailable.
