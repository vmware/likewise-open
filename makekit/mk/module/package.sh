# package.sh -- ad-hoc building of binary packages
#
# This module is the core of a semi-abstract interface
# for building binary packages from the staging area.
#
# Most packaging systems (rpm, debian, etc) use a
# spec file or rules script to invoke the build system
# for the source code and then package up the resulting
# binaries with some metadata.  This module inverts
# that arrangement by invoking the package build system
# from the source build system.  This has a few advantages:
#
# - Easy incremental rebuilding of packages during development
# - The source can be compiled once but packaged several
#   different ways or in different formats
#
# The disadvantages:
#
# - The packages aren't easily reproducible (no SRPMS, etc)
#
# Only some of the details of packaging, such as managing file
# lists, are abstracted away.  The user must still provide
# snippets of spec files, install scripts, etc. on a per-format
# basis.  This allows some build logic to be shared while
# still providing full control over each format's idiosyncracies.
#
# This module only contains core logic.  The user must use
# package-deb, package-rpm, etc. as appropriate.

# Explicitly adds a set of directories to the current package.

# @option SUBDIRS=subdir_list A list of subdirectories

# subdirectories.  A directory in the list may begin
# with <lit>@</lit> to indicate that it is relative

# to the entire project.
