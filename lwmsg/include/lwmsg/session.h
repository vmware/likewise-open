 *
 * A session encapsulates all state in an association between two peers.  Associations
 * delegate session tracking to a session manager which controls creation and state
 * management.  A session contains the following:
 *
 * - A user data pointer for storing custom information about the session
 * - A security token which identifies the peer
 * - A table of handles which allows passing and receiving opaque
 *   object references between peers.
