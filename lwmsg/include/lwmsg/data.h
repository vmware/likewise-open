 * @brief Data marshaling and manipulation
 *
 * The LWMsg data model allows ordinary C data structures to
 * be converted to and from flat octet-stream representations.
 * Before data structures can be processed, a type specification
 * must be constructed which describes the layout and relationships
 * of the structure fields.  For details, see @ref types.
 *
 * The top level object passed to or returned by marshaller operations
 * must always be a pointer.  As a convenience, certain top-level type
 * specifications will automatically be promoted to pointers to accomodate
 * this restriction:
 * - Structures
 *
 * All operations take a data context which controls tunable
 * parameters of the data model:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>Byte order of the octect representation</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * In the event of an error, the data context can be queried for
 * a human-readable diagnostic message.  The data context may
 * also reference an LWMsg context.
 *
